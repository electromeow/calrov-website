# About CALROV

CALROV is a Teknofest team founded under the hood of Istanbul Cağaloğlu Anatolian High School Club of AI and Programming
to compete in the Teknofest Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicles category.\
We are designing a ROV(remotely operated underwater vehicle), hopefully passed the Critical Design Report stage and
deserved to race at the finals.\
\
At the final, we were the only team managed to complete autonomous
task(the vehicle should autonomously go through a door, without manual control,
using image processing, AI and so on...) successfully, and this situation
gave us the top place of the ranking.\
Also made a show to display our success in front of Mustafa Varank(Minister of
Industry and Technology) and Selçuk Bayraktar(owner of BAYKAR, a company of defense industry that produce UAVs).\
Also deserved to have The Most Unique Software award.
